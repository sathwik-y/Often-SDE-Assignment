# Thailand Travel Itinerary System - Implementation Overview

## Steps Followed to Complete the Assignment

1. **Database Architecture Design**
   - Designed a comprehensive SQLAlchemy schema modeling travel itineraries
   - Created entity models for locations, hotels, activities, transfers, and itineraries
   - Implemented relationships between entities for day-wise planning
   - Added proper constraints and indexes for efficient data retrieval

2. **API Development**
   - Built RESTful endpoints using FastAPI for creating and viewing itineraries
   - Implemented robust input validation and standardized error handling
   - Created schema models for request/response serialization
   - Added filtering capabilities for itineraries by duration and recommendation status

3. **MCP Server Implementation**
   - Developed a Model Context Protocol server to provide recommended itineraries
   - Created tools for retrieving itineraries by number of nights
   - Added resource endpoints to expose itinerary information
   - Implemented prompts for itinerary-related queries

4. **Data Seeding**
   - Created realistic data for Phuket and Krabi regions in Thailand
   - Generated varied accommodation options at different price points
   - Added diverse activities and excursions reflective of the regions
   - Created logical transfer options between locations
   - Built recommended itineraries ranging from 2-8 nights

5. **Integration & Testing**
   - Connected all components into a cohesive system
   - Implemented database initialization and seeding processes
   - Tested API endpoints and MCP server functionality
   - Verified data integrity and relationship correctness

## Key Decisions Made During Implementation

1. **Database Schema Design**
   - Used a daily plan approach that links hotel stays, activities, and transfers
   - Implemented many-to-many relationships for activities to allow multiple activities per day
   - Added a recommended flag to easily identify pre-built itineraries

2. **Technology Choices**
   - Selected SQLAlchemy for ORM functionality and database abstraction
   - Used Pydantic for data validation and serialization
   - Implemented FastAPI for high-performance REST endpoints with automatic documentation
   - Used SQLite for simplicity while maintaining upgrade paths to production databases

3. **MCP Implementation**
   - Separated concerns between tools (actions) and resources (data)
   - Created both programmatic and text-based responses for different client needs
   - Implemented proper database connection lifecycle management

## Assumptions Made

1. **User Experience**
   - Users primarily want pre-built itineraries as starting points
   - Most users will search by number of nights rather than specific destinations
   - Price is an important factor in itinerary selection

2. **Data Management**
   - Itineraries will be relatively stable with infrequent updates
   - The system doesn't initially need user accounts or personalization
   - Thailand is the only destination region required initially

3. **Technical Scope**
   - A SQLite database is sufficient for demonstration purposes
   - Authentication and authorization are outside the current scope
   - The system will operate as a backend service with separate frontend components

## Challenges Faced and Solutions

1. **Complex Relationship Modeling**
   - **Challenge**: Designing a schema that allowed flexible itinerary creation while maintaining data integrity
   - **Solution**: Implemented association tables and carefully designed foreign key relationships

2. **MCP Server Parameter Handling**
   - **Challenge**: MCP resource paths required exact parameter matching
   - **Solution**: Modified resource function signatures to match URI parameters exactly and handled context internally

3. **Realistic Data Generation**
   - **Challenge**: Creating meaningful travel data that represented real-world options
   - **Solution**: Researched actual Thailand destinations and activities to create authentic seed data

4. **Database Session Management**
   - **Challenge**: Ensuring proper database connection lifecycle across API and MCP components
   - **Solution**: Implemented context managers and dependency injection for consistent session handling

This implementation provides a solid foundation for a Thailand travel itinerary system with extensibility for future enhancements like user accounts, additional destinations, and more sophisticated recommendation algorithms.
