## Core Technologies

### Python
Python is the primary programming language used in this project. It's popular for backend development due to its readability and extensive libraries.

**Key Python Features Used:**
- Type hints (e.g., `List[int]`, `Optional[str]`) for better code documentation
- Async/await for non-blocking operations
- Context managers (`with` statements) for resource management
- Object-oriented programming patterns

### FastAPI

FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python based on standard Python type hints.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Path Operations**: Routes that handle HTTP requests (e.g., GET, POST)
- **Path Parameters**: Variable parts of the URL path (e.g., `/items/{item_id}`)
- **Query Parameters**: Optional parameters typically used for filtering (e.g., `?limit=10&skip=0`)
- **Request Body**: Data sent by the client in POST/PUT requests
- **Response Models**: Pydantic models that define the structure of API responses
- **Dependencies**: Reusable components injected into path operations (e.g., database sessions)
- **Middleware**: Components that process requests/responses before/after handlers

**Example in Our Project:**
```python
@router.get(
    "/itineraries/", 
    response_model=List[ItineraryResponse]
)
async def get_itineraries(
    nights: Optional[int] = None,
    recommended_only: bool = False,
    skip: int = 0, 
    limit: int = 10,
    db: Session = Depends(get_db)
):
    """
    Retrieve travel itineraries with optional filtering by number of nights.
    """
    query = db.query(Itinerary)
    
    if nights is not None:
        query = query.filter(Itinerary.nights == nights)
    
    if recommended_only:
        query = query.filter(Itinerary.is_recommended == True)
        
    itineraries = query.offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
    return itineraries
```

### SQLAlchemy

SQLAlchemy is a SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Engine**: Core interface to the database
- **Session**: Workspace for database operations
- **Declarative Base**: Foundation for model classes
- **Models**: Python classes that map to database tables
- **Relationships**: Connections between models (one-to-many, many-to-many)
- **Query API**: Interface for retrieving data

**Example in Our Project:**
```python
class Itinerary(Base):
    __tablename__ = "itineraries"

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String(100), nullable=False)
    description = Column(Text)
    nights = Column(Integer, nullable=False)
    total_price = Column(Float)
    is_recommended = Column(Boolean, default=False)
    
    daily_plans = relationship("DailyPlan", back_populates="itinerary", cascade="all, delete-orphan")
```

### Pydantic

Pydantic is a data validation and settings management library using Python type annotations.

**Key Concepts:**
- **BaseModel**: Foundation for data models
- **Field Validation**: Automatic validation based on types and constraints
- **Schema Generation**: Automatic OpenAPI schema generation
- **Config Classes**: Model configuration options

**Example in Our Project:**
```python
class ItineraryCreate(BaseModel):
    name: str
    description: str
    nights: int
    daily_plans: List[DailyPlanCreate]
```

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)

MCP is a protocol for providing context to Language Models in a standardized way.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Resources**: Data exposed to the LLM
- **Tools**: Functions that can be invoked by the LLM
- **Prompts**: Templates for LLM interactions
- **Context Management**: Handling of state between interactions

## Database Design

### Entity-Relationship Model

The database design uses a relational model with several interconnected entities:

1. **Locations**: Geographic places in Thailand
2. **Hotels**: Accommodations at specific locations
3. **Activities**: Things to do at specific locations
4. **Transfers**: Transportation between locations
5. **Itineraries**: Complete travel plans
6. **DailyPlans**: Specific days within an itinerary

### Relationships Explained

- **One-to-Many**:
  - Location has many Hotels
  - Location has many Activities
  - Itinerary has many DailyPlans
  - Hotel has many DailyPlans

- **Many-to-One**:
  - DailyPlan belongs to one Itinerary
  - DailyPlan has one Hotel
  - DailyPlan may have one Transfer

- **Many-to-Many**:
  - DailyPlan can have multiple Activities
  - Activity can be part of multiple DailyPlans

**Why This Design?**
- It models the real-world travel domain naturally
- Supports flexible itinerary creation
- Enables efficient querying and aggregation
- Allows for complex relationships like multi-day stays and multiple activities per day

### Association Tables

Many-to-many relationships in SQLAlchemy require association tables:

```python
daily_plan_activity = Table(
    "daily_plan_activity",
    Base.metadata,
    Column("daily_plan_id", Integer, ForeignKey("daily_plans.id")),
    Column("activity_id", Integer, ForeignKey("activities.id")),
)
```

This table connects daily plans with activities, allowing each plan to have multiple activities and each activity to be part of multiple plans.

## API Development

### RESTful API Principles

The API follows RESTful principles:
- Uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST)
- Resources identified by URLs
- Stateless interactions
- JSON for data interchange
- Error status codes

### API Endpoint Design

1. **Collection Endpoints** (`/itineraries/`)
   - GET: List all itineraries
   - POST: Create a new itinerary

2. **Instance Endpoints** (`/itineraries/{id}`)
   - GET: Retrieve a specific itinerary

### Input Validation

Pydantic models validate input data:
- Types are enforced (string, int, float)
- Required fields are checked
- Relationships are validated

### Error Handling

Standardized error responses with appropriate status codes:
- 404: Resource not found
- 400: Bad request (invalid input)
- 500: Server error

## MCP Server

### MCP Architecture

The MCP server exposes:
1. **Tools**: Functions that perform actions
2. **Resources**: Data that provides context
3. **Prompts**: Templates for interactions

### Tool Implementation

Tools are functions decorated with `@mcp.tool()`:

```python
@mcp.tool()
def get_recommended_itinerary(nights: int, ctx: Context) -> dict:
    """
    Get a recommended itinerary for the specified number of nights.
    """
    # Implementation...
```

### Resource Implementation

Resources are functions decorated with `@mcp.resource()`:

```python
@mcp.resource("itineraries://recommended/{nights}")
def get_recommended_itinerary_resource(nights: str) -> str:
    """
    Get details about recommended itineraries for the specified number of nights.
    """
    # Implementation...
```

### Prompt Implementation

Prompts are functions decorated with `@mcp.prompt()`:

```python
@mcp.prompt()
def recommend_itinerary(nights: int) -> str:
    """Create a prompt for recommending an itinerary for the specified number of nights"""
    # Implementation...
```

## System Architecture

### Three-Tier Architecture

The system follows a three-tier architecture:
1. **Database Tier**: SQLite database with SQLAlchemy models
2. **Application Tier**: FastAPI and MCP servers
3. **Presentation Tier**: API clients (not included in this project)

### Component Interaction

1. **API Server** interacts with the database to:
   - Retrieve itineraries and their components
   - Create new itineraries
   - Handle validation and errors

2. **MCP Server** interacts with the database to:
   - Find recommended itineraries
   - Provide contextual information
   - Generate prompts for LLM interactions

3. **Clients** interact with both servers:
   - REST API for CRUD operations
   - MCP for AI-enhanced recommendations

## Potential Interview Questions

### General Questions

1. **Q: Explain the overall architecture of your Thailand Travel Itinerary System.**
   - A: The system uses a three-tier architecture with a SQLite database, a FastAPI backend, and an MCP server. The database stores travel data for Thailand's Phuket and Krabi regions, the FastAPI backend provides RESTful endpoints for creating and viewing itineraries, and the MCP server provides recommended itineraries based on trip duration.

2. **Q: What technologies did you use and why?**
   - A: I used Python for its readability and extensive libraries, FastAPI for high-performance API development with automatic documentation, SQLAlchemy for flexible ORM capabilities, Pydantic for data validation, and MCP for structured AI integration. SQLite was chosen for simplicity in this demonstration while maintaining upgrade paths to production databases.

### Database Questions

3. **Q: Explain your database schema and the relationships between entities.**
   - A: The schema consists of Locations, Hotels, Activities, Transfers, Itineraries, and DailyPlans. Locations have many Hotels and Activities. Itineraries have many DailyPlans, each with one Hotel, optional Transfer, and many Activities (through a many-to-many relationship). Transfers connect two Locations (origin and destination).

4. **Q: How did you handle the many-to-many relationship between daily plans and activities?**
   - A: I implemented an association table named `daily_plan_activity` that connects the `daily_plans` and `activities` tables. This allows a daily plan to have multiple activities and an activity to be part of multiple daily plans.

5. **Q: How do you calculate the total price of an itinerary?**
   - A: The total price is calculated by summing the hotel prices for each night, the costs of all transfers used, and the prices of all activities included in the itinerary.

### API Questions

6. **Q: Describe your API endpoint design and how it follows RESTful principles.**
   - A: The API follows RESTful principles with endpoints organized around resources. It uses standard HTTP methods (GET for retrieval, POST for creation), represents resources as URLs, uses appropriate status codes for errors, and is stateless.

7. **Q: How did you implement input validation for your API?**
   - A: I used Pydantic models to define and validate request/response schemas. These models enforce type checking, required fields, and data constraints. FastAPI automatically integrates with these models to validate incoming requests and generate OpenAPI documentation.

8. **Q: How did you handle error cases in your API?**
   - A: I implemented standardized error responses using FastAPI's HTTPException with appropriate status codes (400 for bad requests, 404 for not found, etc.) and detailed error messages.

### MCP Server Questions

9. **Q: What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and how did you use it in this project?**
   - A: MCP is a protocol for providing structured context to Language Models. I used it to create a server that provides recommended itineraries based on the number of nights a user wants to travel. It exposes tools for retrieving itineraries, resources for accessing contextual information, and prompts for generating recommendations.

10. **Q: Explain the difference between MCP tools, resources, and prompts.**
    - A: Tools are functions that can be invoked to perform actions (like retrieving a recommended itinerary), resources provide data that can be referenced (like details about itineraries), and prompts are templates that guide AI interactions (like providing a structure for generating travel recommendations).

### Implementation Questions

11. **Q: How did you seed the database with realistic data?**
    - A: I created a seeding script that generates locations, hotels, activities, and transfers based on real places in Thailand's Phuket and Krabi regions. The script then creates complete itineraries with daily plans that include accommodations, transfers, and activities, calculating appropriate prices for each component.

12. **Q: How did you ensure efficient querying of the database?**
    - A: I added appropriate indexes to frequently queried fields like primary and foreign keys. I also designed the relationships to allow for efficient joins when retrieving related data.

13. **Q: How would you extend this system to support user accounts and personalized recommendations?**
    - A: I would add a User model with authentication, create a UserPreference model to store travel preferences, implement a UserItinerary model to store saved and past itineraries, and enhance the recommendation logic to consider user preferences and past behavior.

14. **Q: How would you deploy this system to production?**
    - A: For production deployment, I would switch from SQLite to a more robust database like PostgreSQL, containerize the application with Docker, set up CI/CD pipelines for testing and deployment, implement proper logging and monitoring, and potentially host it on a cloud platform like AWS or GCP with appropriate scaling configurations.

15. **Q: How would you handle scaling if the system became popular?**
    - A: I'd implement database optimization (indexing, query optimization), add caching for frequently accessed data, consider database sharding for large datasets, implement horizontal scaling for the API servers, and potentially add a load balancer to distribute traffic.

### Advanced Questions

16. **Q: How would you optimize the performance of itinerary searches?**
    - A: I'd add full-text search capabilities using a specialized search engine like Elasticsearch, implement caching for popular searches, add pagination for large result sets, and potentially use materialized views for common query patterns.

17. **Q: What security considerations did you address in your implementation?**
    - A: While the current implementation focuses on the core functionality, in a production environment I'd add authentication and authorization, implement input sanitization to prevent SQL injection, add rate limiting to prevent abuse, use HTTPS for all communications, and implement proper error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information.

18. **Q: How would you test this system thoroughly?**
    - A: I'd implement unit tests for individual functions, integration tests for API endpoints, database transaction tests, load testing for performance under stress, and end-to-end tests that simulate real user workflows.

19. **Q: How would you handle internationalization for a global audience?**
    - A: I'd implement a translation system for text content, add support for multiple currencies and date formats, consider region-specific regulations and requirements, and adapt the UI for different reading directions (LTR/RTL) if needed.

20. **Q: What was the most challenging aspect of implementing this system and how did you overcome it?**
    - A: The most challenging aspect was designing a flexible schema that could represent complex travel itineraries while maintaining data integrity and performance. I addressed this by carefully planning the relationships between entities, implementing appropriate constraints, and testing with realistic data to validate the design.
